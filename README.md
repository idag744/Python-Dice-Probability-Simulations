This project demonstrates probability simulations and analytical computations with fair and loaded dice. It covers probability distributions, expected values, variance, covariance, and cumulative probabilities for dice games. The project combines theory with practical Python simulations to explore the impact of dice mechanics on outcomes.

Key concepts:

Probability mass functions (PMFs)

Expected value, variance, and covariance

Fair vs. loaded dice

Simulations to validate theoretical results

Visualization of probability distributions
