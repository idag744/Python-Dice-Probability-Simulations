# Dice Probability Simulations & Analysis

## Overview
This project explores the probability mechanics of dice games using Python. Both fair and loaded dice are considered, and their outcomes are analyzed using simulations and theoretical calculations.

Key learning outcomes:
- Understanding probability mass functions (PMFs)
- Computing expected value, variance, and covariance
- Comparing fair and loaded dice outcomes
- Using simulations to validate theoretical probabilities
- Visualizing probability distributions

## Features
- Simulate dice rolls with any number of sides
- Empirical PMF calculation from simulation
- Theoretical PMF for sums of two dice
- Cumulative probability calculations
- Optional visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Installation
